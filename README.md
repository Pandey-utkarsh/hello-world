# hello-world
My first Repository

Hello there!
Utkarsh Pandey this side. I am a creature of the sort that might look mingling up quite successfully, but my ideologies are way different from the present young generation, but that's what is the specialty of us, we might be mismatching to the ultimate aspect, yet here we are living in the same world, in harmony. 
This is my first interaction with Git-Hub, trying my best to understand it and contribute the maximum I can.
I am persuing Bachelor of Technology program in Electrical Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology, BHU, Varanasi.
